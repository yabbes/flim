## Flim-Base

This is just a little project for me to learn the React framework.
You can enter a search term which will be checked with the [TheMovieDB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/faq/api)

My first own project after many tutorials I followed on the framework. It is still badly coded, the components are with 2 exceptions crammed with the standard app layout from react.

Next project will be more modular and scalable, this one is a mess, actually but it was fun to learn.

Thanks to TheMovieDB for the API
